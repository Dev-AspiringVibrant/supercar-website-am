                Nemesis RR, a fully electric hypercar that pushes the limits of performance and sustainability. Today,
                Trion
                stands as a testament to the relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence in the world of

            <p class="ceo-p">
                Richard (Rich) Patterson, CEO & CTO of Trion Supercars, fulfilled his lifelong dream in May 2012 after
                40 years in the automotive industry by founding Trion with a core team of experts.
            </p>
            <p class="ceo-p">
                Rich's passion for cars started in his Detroit childhood, and at 15, he earned a GM apprenticeship after
                winning a statewide drafting contest. A graduate of Mumford High School and a Hall of Fame inductee,
                Rich began his career as a CAD designer at Modern Engineering, quickly rising to leadership roles due to
                his expertise in automotive interior systems.
            </p>
            <p class="ceo-p">
                With over two decades of experience, including contributions to Chrysler's Stow 'n Go seating system,
                Rich moved to the West Coast to immerse himself in design innovation. Today, he brings his vision to
                life with Trion Supercars, offering high-performance American-made supercars that combine style, speeds
                of 300 mph, and comfort. Trion offers a variety of powertrain options, including traditional gasoline
                engines, hybrid systems, and fully electric models.
